=  Todo / Ideas for next year

 - make ui choice buttons for switching between android / iphone / generic at top of login / home screen

 - consider less judging score factors

 - analyze past judging data and see if judge scaling (base on judges average scoring) helps

 - make checkin faster (break down by grade, search by last or first name)

 - allow judges to re-visit past judgements and adjust them.

 - add names to hover on "floor" page

 - get judge system working online, so judges and staff can try out application at anytime

 - consider static judge to student assigmnment instead of dynamic

 - fudging anything currently requires mysql skills..   perhaps a ui for fudging (aka adding/removing single students, unchecking
   in a student, adding a single judge or student, pairing or unpairing students, adding a single student)

 - extra password for awards page.
