# What is the Judge application

The judge application is configured with a set of judges (name and grade assigned) and a set of projects.   The judges
use the application to find out which projects need to be scored.  They then input their judgement for an assigned
project.   They then repeat until all projects have been judged three times.

The judge application also has an administrator interface.   This interfaces allows the science fair staff to check
 students in and monitor the progress of the science fair.

## What Does a Judge Do?

A judge uses an ipad/iphone/android/tablet to connect to the application.  The judge then finds their name and the grade
the are assigned to on a dropdown.   The judge then enters the password and clicks login.

The judge see sees the begin screen.    This screen confirms their identity, and shows them how many projects they
   have judged and shows them how many more they could possibly judge.   For example if 3rd grade had 20 students and
   two of them were already judged by this judge, then 17 possible students remain.

A judge uses the application to request a project to judge.   The judge is then assigned a project and asked to judge it.
The screen includes a bunch of things they should ensure the project has (the checkboxes), 4 subjective scores and
lastly a multiplier.

After the judge makes their choices they submit them.   They are then shown a summary screen,
